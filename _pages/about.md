I am a Software engineer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, currently living in Barcelona. I graduated
from [National Technological University of Buenos Aires](https://www.frba.utn.edu.ar/) as a Systems Engineering degree. During the last 3 years I have worked at [Glovo](https://about.glovoapp.com/) during its hyper-growth fase where the company transitioned from a startup to a large-scale company providing its services in multiple regions.

I enjoy learning about anything, and I approach challenges in a systematic way that allows me to solve them even
when it is a new field for me. I enjoy working with smart and enthusiastic people that also wants to build amazing projects and exchange knowledge.
